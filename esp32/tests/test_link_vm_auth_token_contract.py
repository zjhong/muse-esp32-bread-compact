"""Keep VM selection and its credential paired throughout the connection path.

The client must preserve three invariants:

  1. Send the selected fetch_vms entry's vm_auth_token without changing its bytes.
  2. Refuse a missing token; do not substitute an account-wide or device credential.
  3. Keep credentials isolated between VM entries, including across VM switches.

Each token is bound to a VM through its env_id. The edge proxy rejects a token
for a different VM before the connection reaches that VM, so mixing entries
causes a connection failure and repeated retries across affected devices.

The rules are enforced in three places, and each is covered by running the real
code under a host harness:

  tests/link_vm_api_harness.c      parsing a fetch_vms response — one
                                   independent token per entry, stored verbatim
  tests/link_vm_connect_harness.c  choosing what to connect with — the id and
                                   the token come from one entry, or we refuse
  tests/link_noise_upgrade_harness.c  what goes on the wire — the exact token,
                                   in a header, for this vm_id

The first two are run by tests/test_link_vm_api.py and this module; the third by
tests/test_link_noise_session.py.
