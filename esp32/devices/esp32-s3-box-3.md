# Espressif ESP32-S3-BOX-3

This profile runs Muse's avatar, touch settings, push-to-talk, spoken replies,
images, BLE setup, Wi-Fi, and home-network tunnel on the **BOX-3**. It is not
a profile for the original ESP32-S3-BOX or BOX-Lite.

Hardware initialization uses the pinned `espressif/esp-box-3` 3.2.0 BSP. Its
[source](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/esp-box-3) supplies
the pin map and detects the ST7789/TT21100 and ILI9341/GT911 display revisions.
The main unit has 16 MB flash, 16 MB octal PSRAM, a 320×240 touch LCD, ES8311
speaker codec and ES7210 microphone ADC.

## Build on Windows

Use an **ESP-IDF v6.0.1** PowerShell environment. The repository requires this
version; a 5.5 environment is not supported. From the repository's `esp32`
directory, define the profile arguments once:

```powershell
$box3Args = @(
    '-B', 'build-muse-espressif-box-3',
    '-DIDF_TARGET=esp32s3',
    '-DSDKCONFIG=build-muse-espressif-box-3/sdkconfig',
    '-DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.muse;devices/sdkconfig.muse-espressif-box-3'
)
idf.py @box3Args menuconfig
```

Under **ESP32 Device SDK**, enter your SDK token from
**gadgets.muse.ai → Account → SDK tokens** (`CONFIG_GADGET_SDK_TOKEN`). Save
and exit, then build:

```powershell
idf.py @box3Args build
```

The token stays in the ignored `build-muse-espressif-box-3/sdkconfig` and the
compiled firmware. Do not put it in the board overlay or commit it. A build
without the token is useful for compilation checks, but is not a completed
pairing setup.

The firmware is `build-muse-espressif-box-3/muse-gadget.bin`. Flashing also
needs the bootloader and partition table from that directory; use `idf.py`
with the same arguments instead of writing just the app at an assumed offset.

On Linux/macOS, after activating ESP-IDF v6.0.1:

```sh
tools/muse/board.sh build box3
```

The helper uses the same build directory. Builds for different boards share
`managed_components/` and `dependencies.lock`; do not run them concurrently.

## Flash and pair

Connect a data cable to the main unit's USB-C connector. List ports without
resetting the device:

```powershell
python -m serial.tools.list_ports -v
```

The native ESP32-S3 USB Serial/JTAG device normally has VID:PID `303A:1001`.
Other Espressif boards share that ID; identify the BOX-3's port before flashing.
Replace `COM7` below with that port. To retain the factory firmware, make a
full flash backup before the first Muse flash:

```powershell
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p COM7 read-flash 0 0x1000000 box3-factory.bin
idf.py @box3Args -p COM7 flash monitor
```

Store the backup outside version control. Flashing replaces the factory
firmware and its partition layout. If the port is absent or flashing cannot
connect, hold BOOT/CONFIG, tap RESET, release BOOT/CONFIG, and check ports again.
Exit the monitor with **Ctrl+]**.

Pair `MuseGadget-XXXXXX` in the Muse app, provide Wi-Fi credentials, and press
BOOT/CONFIG to confirm when prompted. Once connected, hold BOOT/CONFIG to
record a voice message and release it to send. Settings use the touchscreen.

## Controls and limits

- BOOT/CONFIG (GPIO0): pairing confirmation, push-to-talk and wake from sleep.
- The hardware microphone mute button cuts ADC power and its data output.
  The port reads its active-low status on GPIO1 and reinitializes the ES7210
  after unmuting; it also boots while muted. A short settling interval after
  unmute is discarded. The button is not reassigned as a menu button.
- The capacitive home button is not integrated; use touch settings.
- Power off puts the ESP32 into deep sleep and disables the backlight and
  speaker amplifier. It cannot disconnect USB power; dock peripherals may
  stay powered. BOOT/CONFIG or RESET wakes it.
- Dock sensors, SD card, IR, battery telemetry, and wake-word detection are
  not integrated. Voice uses the SDK's existing push-to-talk processing.

## Hardware verification

Booting, display, touch, BLE pairing and audio capture have been checked on a
BOX-3. Complete these checks before treating the port as fully hardware-tested:

1. Boot reports the BOX-3 board name and PSRAM, without panics or reset loops.
2. The display has correct colors/orientation and touch aligns at all corners.
3. BLE pairing, button confirmation and Wi-Fi reconnect work.
4. Push-to-talk records intelligible audio, spoken replies play, volume and
   microphone gain work, and the hardware mute button silences capture.
   Unmuting must restore speech without RESET; also test booting while muted.
5. Images and settings work while the network session remains connected.
6. Screen timeout, touch/button wake, power off and BOOT/CONFIG wake work.
