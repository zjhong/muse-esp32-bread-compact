# Devices

These are the boards the ESP32 Device SDK runs on. Each board is an `sdkconfig`
overlay: a short file of settings loaded on top of
[`../sdkconfig.defaults`](../sdkconfig.defaults) that picks the chip, flash,
memory, button, and how the device shows its status. The ESP32-C5 DevKitC-1 is
the default and needs no overlay.

Every board pairs with the Muse app, joins your Wi-Fi, and holds an encrypted
session to Muse. The rest depends on the hardware.

Boards without PSRAM (the ideaspark, Waveshare C6 and Cardputer ADV) don't have room for
the home-network tunnel. Muse can still reach and control them once the
control session is up. The Waveshare C6 and Cardputer ADV also can't hold their own voice
session, so push-to-talk sends your voice note over its control session to the
Muse it's paired with, and the reply scrolls past as text. It can't show images either: the UI holds a whole image in
PSRAM, where the ideaspark draws one straight to its screen.

The SenseCAP Indicator's sensors hang off its RP2040, which passes the
readings to the ESP32-S3. The D1S and D1Pro have CO2 and tVOC sensors built
in, and temperature and humidity come from the Grove AHT20 in the box (plug it
in). Muse reads them all at once with `sensors.read`. This needs Seeed's stock
RP2040 firmware.

The reTerminal E1001's e-paper shows only black and white, 1 bit per pixel,
and keeps its picture without power. It shows a still status screen (the
agent's name, the character and a line of status text) that changes only when
the status does, since each refresh takes a second or two. Images from Muse are dithered
to black and white on the device and refresh once they are all in, with a
brief black-and-white flash. `display.draw_url` tells Muse the bit depth.

The SenseCAP Watcher keeps its factory data (the identity SenseCraft uses) in
an `nvsfactory` partition at `0x9000`, where Muse puts its partition table and
NVS. It's unique to each Watcher, so back it up before you flash Muse the first
time. To return to Seeed's firmware, flash it and then write the backup back:

```sh
tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0x9000 0x32000 nvsfactory.bin
tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT write-flash 0x9000 nvsfactory.bin
```

The Watcher's CH342 USB bridge corrupts reads at 921600 baud and above, so
these use esptool's default of 115200. It also drops bytes when a whole packet
arrives at once, so plain esptool can't upload its stub or write flash
(`0107: Checksum error`, `0105: The format of the received message is
invalid`). `tools/muse/paced_esptool.py` takes esptool's arguments and sends 64
bytes at a time at the line rate; `tools/muse/board.sh flash watcher` uses it.

The M5Stack StickS3 has 8 MB of flash, so it uses its own partition table with
two smaller app slots. The front button is push-to-talk and the side button
steps through the menu, as on the AIPI. Powering off from Muse turns off the
screen, speaker and codec and puts the ESP32-S3 in deep sleep; either button
wakes it. Double-click the power button for a full power-off, and click it to
turn back on. Muse turns off the power chip's green LED, which would otherwise
stay lit. The IMU, IR and Grove port aren't used yet.
[M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) is M5Stack's reference
driver for the power chip and peripherals.

M5Stack ships the StickS3 with UiFlow2, which hands the ESP32-S3's USB to its
own driver and switches off the chip's USB serial port, so esptool can't find
it. The power chip drives the boot pin (GPIO0), so there's no BOOT button
either. To flash Muse the first time, put UiFlow2 in USB mode, open its REPL
(for example with `mpremote repl`) and paste:

```python
import machine; m = machine.mem32
m[0x600C001C] = m[0x600C001C] | (1 << 10)                 # USB serial clock on
m[0x600C0024] = m[0x600C0024] & ~(1 << 10)                # and out of reset
m[0x60038018] = 0x4200                                    # its pads on
m[0x60008120] = (m[0x60008120] | (1 << 20)) & ~(1 << 19)  # give it the USB pins
```

The REPL stops answering. Unplug the USB cable and plug it back in (the
battery keeps the stick running), and it shows up as a USB JTAG/serial port.
Anything that resets the stick now boots UiFlow2 again, so pass
`--after no-reset` to esptool until Muse is on. Back up the flash, then flash
Muse:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT --after no-reset read-flash 0 0x800000 sticks3.bin
tools/muse/board.sh flash sticks3 PORT
```

Muse keeps the USB serial port on, so later flashes need none of this. To go
back to UiFlow2, write the backup:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT write-flash 0 sticks3.bin
```

The M5Stack StopWatch has the same CO5300 round AMOLED as the Waveshare S3
1.75C, with a CST820 touch controller and the StickS3's ES8311 audio. The
yellow button (upper left) is push-to-talk and the blue one (upper right) puts
the screen to sleep; settings are on the touch screen. Powering off from Muse
turns off the screen, touch, audio and the expander's L3B rail and puts the
ESP32-S3 in deep sleep; either button wakes it. Double-click the power button
for a full power-off, and click it to turn back on. M5's IO expander (M5IOE1)
switches the panel and touch resets, audio power and the amp; its power chip
(M5PM1) reads the battery and the charger. The IMU, RTC, vibration motor and
Grove port aren't used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified)
and M5's [factory firmware](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StopWatch-UserDemo)
are the references. It enumerates as the chip's own USB serial port, so
flashing needs nothing special: `tools/muse/board.sh flash stopwatch`.

The M5Stack StickC Plus2 is the only board with the full UI on a classic ESP32. It has
8 MB of flash and 2 MB of PSRAM, so it uses the 8 MB partition table too. The
front button is push-to-talk and the side button steps through the menu. The
power button wakes the screen, and holding it for 2 s powers off. There's no
power chip: the power button switches the stick on and the ESP32 keeps it on
(GPIO4). Powering off lets go of that, which cuts the power on battery. On
USB the stick stays powered, so the ESP32 also goes into deep sleep, and the
front or power button wakes it. Muse speaks through a small passive buzzer,
so replies are quiet. The battery shows its voltage, but the stick can't tell
Muse whether it's on USB or charging. The IMU, IR, RTC and Grove port aren't
used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) and
[M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX) are M5Stack's reference drivers
for the pins and peripherals.

The Plus2's console is a CH9102 USB-UART bridge, which drops out above
230400 baud, so `tools/muse/board.sh flash plus2` uses 230400. It comes with
M5Stack's factory firmware. Back up the flash before you flash Muse for the
first time:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32 -p PORT -b 230400 read-flash 0 0x800000 plus2.bin
```

To go back, write the backup with `write-flash 0 plus2.bin`, using the same
chip, port and baud.

## Cardputer ADV port

Experimental ADV-only port, tested with ESP-IDF 6.0.1. Supports the display,
keyboard, BLE/Wi-Fi pairing, voice notes and text replies.

- Hold **Space/GO** to talk. **Esc** opens/closes the menu or goes back;
  **Enter** selects and confirms pairing.
- **Up/Down** (`;`/`.`) navigate; **Left/Right** (`,`/`/`) change values,
  with or without Fn. Typing chat messages is not supported.
- Menu power-off enters deep sleep; **GO** wakes it. Use the side switch
  for physical power-off.

Replies may be shortened; use the Muse app for the full conversation.
Spoken replies, images, the home-network tunnel, battery telemetry and
extra peripherals (SD, IMU, IR, expansion) are not supported.

Set your SDK token in `build-muse-m5stack-cardputer-adv/sdkconfig` (ignored
by Git). Build with `tools/muse/board.sh build cardputer-adv` and flash with
`tools/muse/board.sh flash cardputer-adv PORT`. To enter download mode,
switch off, hold GO while connecting USB, then release GO.

Back up the original 8 MB firmware before flashing; keep it outside Git:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0 0x800000 cardputer-adv-backup.bin
```

Restore with `write-flash 0 cardputer-adv-backup.bin`. Pair in Muse under
Settings > Devices > Developer mode > Add Device, then press Enter.

## ESP32-S3-BOX-3

The BOX-3 port uses Espressif’s BSP for the LCD/touch hardware revisions and
the ES8311/ES7210 audio codecs. BOOT/CONFIG is push-to-talk and pairing
confirmation; settings use the touchscreen. The capacitive home button, dock
sensors, SD card, IR, and battery telemetry are not integrated. Power off
enters deep sleep; BOOT/CONFIG or RESET wakes the unit.

See [BOX-3 setup](esp32-s3-box-3.md) for PowerShell build and flash commands,
token setup, and the hardware verification checklist.

`tools/board.sh BOARD [build|flash|monitor|flash-monitor] [PORT]` builds each
board in its own `build-<board>` directory. For the boards with the full UI, run `idf.py`
with the target and overlays from the table:

```sh
idf.py -B build-muse-aipi -DIDF_TARGET=esp32s3 \
  -DSDKCONFIG=build-muse-aipi/sdkconfig \
  -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.muse;devices/sdkconfig.muse-aipi" build
```

To flash, add `-p PORT flash` with the same arguments. Boards with the full UI need 16 MB
of flash or more, except the StickS3, StickC Plus2 and Cardputer ADV, whose overlays switch
to the 8 MB layout in [`partitions_muse_8mb.csv`](../partitions_muse_8mb.csv).
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) covers flashing, monitoring, and what to do when a
build picks up stale settings.

## Add a board

1. Copy the closest overlay here as `sdkconfig.<yourboard>`.
2. Set at least `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`, `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_BUTTON_GPIO`, the status
   backend (`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_*`), and the flash size and mode.
3. Without PSRAM, also turn off `CONFIG_SPIRAM` and `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_TUNNEL` and
   keep mbedtls in internal memory, as [`sdkconfig.ideaspark`](sdkconfig.ideaspark)
   does.
4. Build with `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.<yourboard>"`
   and add your board to the tables above.

A board with a new kind of display, or one that runs the UI, needs code
as well. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) walks through every kind of board, from the
overlay to testing on hardware.

### Watcher camera

Camera support is disabled by default. In the Watcher build's `menuconfig`,
under **Muse**, enable **SenseCAP Watcher camera capture and live preview**
(`CONFIG_MUSE_WATCHER_CAMERA=y`) and rebuild. It requires PSRAM. Disabled
builds omit the camera worker, shutter UI, double-click gesture, and
`camera.capture` command.

Double-click the wheel to open a live camera view. Aim the Watcher, then tap
**TAP TO TAKE PHOTO** or double-click the wheel again. The captured frame stays
on screen. Tap the image to return to the avatar.

The `camera.capture` command returns a JPEG in
`payload.data_base64`, with `payload.format` set to `jpeg-base64`. During live
preview it returns the latest frame. Otherwise it requests a fresh frame.
Capture runs asynchronously and reports initialization, timeout, or busy errors.
The camera uses the existing Himax firmware. It's powered only while a capture
or the live view runs (a capture takes under a second, start-up included), and
nothing polls it in between.
Photo attachments to voice messages are not included.
