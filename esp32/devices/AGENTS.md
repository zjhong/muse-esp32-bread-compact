# Adding a device

A recipe for porting the firmware to a new ESP32 board. Read `../AGENTS.md`
first for building, flashing and monitoring. Paths below are relative to
`esp32/`.

## Vendor sources

Before you add a feature to a board (its IMU, camera, RTC, SD card, power
chip and so on) or port a board from the same vendor, read the vendor's own
code for it. Clone the repo rather than reading it on the web, and search it.

| Board | Vendor source | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C | [waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C) | `Schematic/`. `examples/esp-idf/` for the AXP2101 power chip (`01_AXP2101`) and the QMI8658 IMU (`04_Immersive_block`). `examples/arduino/examples/` for the ES7210 mics and the ES8311 codec. Muse drives the display, touch and codec through its BSP, `waveshare/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_75c`. |
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75 | [waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75) | The 1.75C's chips on other pins (LCD and touch reset on GPIO 39 and 40, MCLK on 42), plus an SD slot on GPIO 1 to 3 and a TCA9554 expander. PWR reaches the ESP32 only through the AXP2101. Muse uses the 1.75C driver with its BSP, `waveshare/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_75`. |
| Seeed SenseCAP Watcher | [Seeed-Studio/SenseCAP-Watcher-Firmware](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SenseCAP-Watcher-Firmware) | `components/sensecap-watcher/` is Seeed's BSP. `include/sensecap-watcher.h` has the pins for the LCD, touch, knob, IO expander, audio, battery, SD card and the Himax camera chip (driven through `components/sscma_client/`). `examples/factory_firmware/` is the firmware it ships with. xiaozhi-esp32's [sensecap-watcher board](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32/tree/main/main/boards/sensecap-watcher) is a second reference. |
| Every M5Stack board (StickS3, StickC Plus2, Cardputer ADV, StopWatch) | [m5stack/M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified), and [M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX) for the panels | `src/M5Unified.inl` for pins, buttons and audio. `src/utility/` for power and the battery (`Power_Class.inl`), the IMU, RTC, mic, speaker and LEDs. `src/M5GFX.cpp` in M5GFX for the panel. Search both for the model's `board_M5...` name. For the StopWatch, M5's factory firmware [m5stack/M5StopWatch-UserDemo](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StopWatch-UserDemo): `main/hal/` for the power chip, IO expander, buttons and audio, and `main/apps/app_stopwatch/view/view.cpp` for where the buttons sit. |
| Espressif ESP32-S3-BOX-3 | [espressif/esp-bsp](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp) | `bsp/esp-box-3/`: pins in `include/bsp/esp-box-3.h`, LCD/touch revision detection and codecs in `esp-box-3.c`, duplex I2S in `esp-box-3_idf5.c`. |
| AIPI Lite | xiaozhi-esp32's [aipi-lite board](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32/tree/main/main/boards/xorigin/aipi-lite) | `config.h` for pins, then `aipi-lite.cc` and `power_manager.h`. |
| Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition | [esphome/home-assistant-voice-pe](https://github.com/esphome/home-assistant-voice-pe) | `home-assistant-voice.yaml`, its ESPHome config. |

For the Cardputer ADV keyboard, also read [m5stack/M5Cardputer](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Cardputer), especially `src/utility/Keyboard/KeyboardReader/TCA8418.cpp` and `src/utility/Adafruit_TCA8418/`.

## 1. Gather the facts

Collect these before you write anything, and cite where each came from (the
vendor source, wiki, schematic, BSP or a reference firmware such as
xiaozhi-esp32) in a comment at the top of the overlay or board file. Don't
guess pins.

- Chip and module: target, flash size, PSRAM size and mode (none, quad or
  octal; an `R8` in an S3 part number means 8 MB octal).
- USB: native USB (`usbmodem`, `ttyACM`) or a bridge such as a CH340 or
  CH9102 (`usbserial`, `wchusbserial`, `ttyUSB`), with its USB vendor and
  product ID. The Muse tools find boards by these, not by port name.
- Buttons and their GPIOs. BOOT is GPIO0 on the ESP32 and S3, GPIO9 on the C3
  and C6, and GPIO28 on the C5.
- The status light, if any: type (addressable or PWM RGB) and pins.
- The display: controller, bus (SPI, QSPI, RGB, I80), resolution, pins and
  backlight. Touch controller and pins.
- Audio codec, mic and speaker. The PMU or battery sense.
- Whether the vendor publishes a BSP in the ESP Component Registry.

For an M5Stack board, or any board from a vendor under Vendor sources, start
from that vendor's code.

## 2. Pick the kind

| Kind | Status shown on | You add | Start from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Light | status LED, or nothing | an overlay | `sdkconfig.defaults` (the C5 DevKitC-1) |
| Status screen | edge bars and an animation | an overlay and a display backend in `main/` | `sdkconfig.ideaspark`, `sdkconfig.sensecap-indicator` |
| E-paper | a status screen with text | an overlay and its own `led_status.h` implementation | `sdkconfig.reterminal-e1001`, `main/epaper_status.c` |
| UI | LVGL avatar, voice and settings | an overlay on top of `sdkconfig.muse` and a `muse_board_t` | `sdkconfig.muse-*` |

A board with a screen, mic and speaker should run the full UI. The UI needs 8 MB
of flash or more: 16 MB boards use `partitions_muse.csv`, and 8 MB boards
`partitions_muse_8mb.csv`. Without PSRAM it loses the tunnel and images, and voice
notes go over Link's session with text-only replies. Link builds need 8 MB or
more, since `partitions.csv` ends past 4 MB and its offsets must not move.

## 3. Name it

Use the vendor and model, in lowercase with hyphens, and add the chip and
screen size when the vendor sells the model in several versions
(`waveshare-s3-175c`). Reuse that name everywhere:

| Where | Light / status screen | UI |
|---|---|---|
| Overlay | `devices/sdkconfig.<name>` | `devices/sdkconfig.muse-<name>` |
| Helper | `tools/board.sh <name>` | `tools/muse/board.sh build <alias>` |
| Kconfig | `HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_<VENDOR>_<CONTROLLER>` (new backends only) | `MUSE_BOARD_<NAME>`, `MUSE_BOARD_ID "<name_with_underscores>"` |
| Source | `main/led_status.c` block | `components/muse/boards/board_<name_with_underscores>.c` |

## 4. Write the overlay (every board)

Copy the closest overlay and keep its layout: a header comment naming the
board, its chip, flash, PSRAM and USB bridge, which file it loads after, then
settings grouped under short comments saying why. Set:

- `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET="esp32xx"`.
- `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_BUTTON_GPIO`. The button is active low with an internal
  pull-up. Boards with the full UI ignore it, because their talk button confirms pairing.
- The status backend, `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_*=y` (`..._NONE` for no
  light). `sdkconfig.muse` sets `..._MUSE` for you.
- Flash: `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_<N>MB=y` and
  `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE="<N>MB"`. Use `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE_DIO=y`
  unless you know the part does QIO.
- PSRAM. `sdkconfig.defaults` assumes quad. Octal needs `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MODE_OCT=y`
  (see `sdkconfig.sensecap-indicator`). With no PSRAM, copy the whole block from
  `sdkconfig.ideaspark`: `CONFIG_SPIRAM=n`, mbedtls internal allocation,
  `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_SSL_OUT_CONTENT_LEN=4096` and `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_TUNNEL=n`.
- `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_BLE_NAME_PREFIX="HomeLink-Disp"` on status-screen boards.
  Light boards keep the default, and `sdkconfig.muse` sets `MuseGadget`.
- On a classic ESP32, `sdkconfig.ideaspark`'s chip block: `CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN_3=y`
  (signed apps need it), BLE-only BTDM, and the Wi-Fi and lwIP IRAM options off.

`sdkconfig.defaults` is tuned for the C5 (IRAM placement, Wi-Fi buffers). On
other chips, Kconfig ignores options that don't exist and drops options whose
dependencies aren't met, without failing the build. Step 8 checks for this.

## 5. Status-screen boards: add a display backend

Everything above the panel comes for free under `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_DISPLAY`: bars,
animation, agent name, connected dot, images and the `display.*` commands.
Your backend supplies the panel.

In `main/Kconfig.projbuild`:

- Add `config HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_<X>` to the `HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND` choice,
  with `depends on` for the target (and `SPIRAM` if it needs a frame buffer in
  PSRAM), and mention the board in the choice's help.
- Add `default y if HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_<X>` to `HOMEHUB_DISPLAY`.

In `main/led_status.c`:

- Pins and geometry: an `#elif CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_<X>` block beside the
  ideaspark and SenseCAP Indicator ones. Define `LCD_NAME`, `LCD_H_RES`,
  `LCD_V_RES` (portrait), `LCD_PIN_BL`, `LCD_BAR_ROWS`, `LCD_ANIM_SCALE`,
  `LCD_DOT_MARGIN`, `LCD_BUF_CAPS` and your bus pins. The animation is 56×59
  cells, so keep `56 * LCD_ANIM_SCALE <= LCD_H_RES`.
- The panel functions: `lcd_draw()` (it returns once `buf` can be reused),
  `lcd_from_be()` (the panel's RGB565 byte order), `lcd_panel_init()` (it
  creates `s_panel`) and `lcd_panel_on()`.
- Four places split `#if ..._IDEASPARK_ST7789` / `#else`, with the SenseCAP
  Indicator as the `#else`: the includes, `lcd_draw()` and `lcd_from_be()`,
  `lcd_panel_init()` and `lcd_panel_on()`, and the pixel copy in
  `lcd_draw_image_rect()`. Turn each `#else` into
  `#elif CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_SENSECAP_ST7701` and add yours. The pixel
  copy depends only on byte order. SPI panels usually take big-endian like the
  ideaspark, and RGB frame buffers take native order like the SenseCAP
  Indicator.
- `led_hw_init()` turns the backlight on by driving `LCD_PIN_BL` high. A
  backlight that is active low, PWM or behind an expander needs a change there.

If the panel driver isn't part of `esp_lcd` in IDF v6.0.1 (check
`$IDF_PATH/components/esp_lcd`), add it to `main/idf_component.yml`, and to
`GADGET_REQUIRES` in `main/CMakeLists.txt` under an `if()` for your backend, as
`led_strip` is. Images from Muse are sized with
`tools/image_for_display.py --width W --height H`.

A status light the existing backends don't cover (another pin or LED type)
follows the same two steps. Copy `DEVKIT_GPIO27` (addressable) or `PWM_RGB`.

## 6. Boards with the full UI: add a board

1. **Kconfig.** In `components/muse/Kconfig`, add `config MUSE_BOARD_<NAME>`
   to the `MUSE_BOARD` choice with `depends on IDF_TARGET_<CHIP>`. Then add
   `default "<id>" if MUSE_BOARD_<NAME>` to `MUSE_BOARD_ID`, above
   `default "none"`.
2. **Sources.** In `components/muse/CMakeLists.txt`, add
   `elseif(CONFIG_MUSE_BOARD_<NAME>)` and `list(APPEND srcs "boards/board_<id>.c")`.
   Any new IDF component goes in the unconditional `REQUIRES` or
   `PRIV_REQUIRES`, because requirements resolve before Kconfig.
3. **Managed components.** In `components/muse/idf_component.yml`, add the
   vendor BSP with `rules: - if: "$CONFIG{MUSE_BOARD_ID} == \"<id>\""`. Add
   `<id>` to the `esp_lvgl_adapter` rule if you use it. Always key rules on
   `MUSE_BOARD_ID`, never on `MUSE_BOARD_<NAME>`, which is undefined on other
   targets.
4. **Board file.** Write `components/muse/boards/board_<id>.c`. It defines a
   `static const muse_board_t s_board` (see `muse_board.h`) and
   `muse_board_get()`. Start from `board_waveshare_c6_18.c` or
   `board_waveshare_s3_175c.c` when a vendor BSP does the display, touch,
   codec and PMU. Start from `board_aipi.c` when you drive `esp_lcd`, the codec
   and GPIOs yourself.
5. **Overlay.** Write `devices/sdkconfig.muse-<name>`, loaded after
   `sdkconfig.muse`. It holds the target, `CONFIG_MUSE_BOARD_<NAME>=y`, PSRAM,
   the flash size if it isn't 16 MB (with 8 MB, also
   `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM_FILENAME="partitions_muse_8mb.csv"`), and any
   LVGL fonts or options the board needs. Leave bench options, like
   screenshots, to `sdkconfig.muse-bench` (`MUSE_BENCH=1`).
6. **Helper.** Add a case to `tools/muse/board.sh` with a short alias, the
   profile (the overlay suffix), the target, and `baud` if its USB bridge
   can't take 460800. Add the alias to the usage comment and to `${2:?...}`.
   In `tools/muse/ports.py`, map the alias to its console's USB vendor and
   product ID in `USB` (a new bridge gets a constant and a `KINDS` name), and
   add it to `COMMANDS` if its console takes Muse's serial commands. Then map
   the board's `name` to the alias in `BOARDS` in `tools/muse/avatar.py`.

The fields of `muse_board_t`:

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `name`, `width`, `height` | The panel as the UI draws it |
| `round`, `touch` | Round panel; `touch` only if `display_start` returns an input device |
| `keyboard` | Dedicated navigation keys: `poll_buttons` emits `MUSE_BTN_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/ENTER/ESCAPE` presses. Enter selects and confirms pairing; Talk is not repurposed as Select while the menu is open. Defaults to false for two-button boards. |
| `talk_button`, `aux_button` | On-screen captions ("boot", "pwr"). `talk_hint` and `aux_hint` place them next to the physical button |
| `frame_ms` | Avatar frame period: 40 on the S3 boards, 50 on the C6 |
| `init` | Runs first: power latches, I2C bus, PMU |
| `display_start` | Panel, LVGL and its task. Returns the display; leaves `*touch` NULL without touch |
| `display_lock`, `display_unlock` | LVGL's lock |
| `set_brightness` | 0 to 100 |
| `panel_sleep` | Puts the panel to sleep when the screen goes off. May be NULL: then only the backlight turns off |
| `display_pause` | Once the screen is dark on battery: stops LVGL (`esp_lv_adapter_pause`), sleeps the touch controller and stops anything else holding a PM lock, so the chip can light-sleep. Only buttons wake it. With a USB host attached the CPU stays at full speed anyway. May be NULL: LVGL keeps running and the CPU stays at full speed. Needs the PM block in the overlay (see `sdkconfig.muse-aipi`), and with PSRAM its static-buffers block too: light sleep's code takes internal RAM Link needs |
| `audio_init` | `esp_codec_dev` speaker and mic. `mic_slot` is 0 or 1, or -1 to mix. `set_mic_gain` may be NULL |
| `poll_buttons` | Called every 10 ms, or 50 ms while the display is paused and `wait_buttons` is NULL. Returns `MUSE_BTN_*` edges. Use `muse_gpio_button_*` for GPIO buttons, or `muse_pmu_poll_key()` for an AXP2101 PWR key |
| `wait_buttons` | While the display is paused: blocks until a button changes, so the chip light-sleeps instead of waking to poll. `muse_gpio_buttons_wait()` for GPIO buttons; a key only the PMU sees has to be polled. May be NULL: polled every 50 ms |
| `read_power` | May be NULL (no battery). `muse_pmu_read_power` on an AXP2101. Leave `battery_mv` 0 if the board can't measure the voltage in millivolts. The battery meter (`muse_battery.h`: Settings → Battery, `tools/muse/power.py`) reads it |
| `power_off` | Required. Returns only if it fails |

On a classic ESP32 (see `board_m5stack_stickc_plus2.c`):

- There's no USB Serial/JTAG, so the Muse tools use the console UART behind
  the USB bridge. `muse_console.h` covers both; don't call either driver
  directly.
- Set `CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_STACK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY=y` (with
  `CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN_3=y`). Muse's voice task keeps its stack in PSRAM, and
  without it the board asserts at boot and restarts in a loop.
- GPIO34 to 39 are inputs only, with no pull-ups. Buttons on them need the
  board's own pull-ups.
- Only I2S0 does PDM. Its PDM-to-PCM filter leaves a large DC offset, so
  remove it before the mic gain or the samples clip. Each 16-bit stereo pair
  lands swapped in memory, so a mic on the right slot is `mic_slot` 0.

## 7. Wire up the tools and docs

- For light and status-screen boards, add a case to `tools/board.sh` with
  `TARGET`, the overlay appended to `DEFAULTS`, and the `PORTS` globs for its
  USB. Add a line to the usage comment, and widen the `sed -n '16,26p'` range
  in `usage()` by the lines you added.
- In `devices/README.md`, add a row to Supported devices, a column to
  Features, and a row to Build. Link only to reference and store pages you
  have opened, and use "—" when there is none.
- If the vendor publishes code for the board, add it to Vendor sources above.
- Add the board to the Supported boards table in `../AGENTS.md` and the Boards
  table in `../README.md`. If the board changes the BLE name or how status is
  shown, update "First boot and pairing" too.

## 8. Verify

1. Build the new board from scratch in its own directory (delete it first if
   it exists): `tools/board.sh <name> build` or
   `tools/muse/board.sh build <alias>`.
2. Check that every line of the overlay reached the generated config. Anything
   listed was misspelled, or had its dependencies unmet:

   ```sh
   o=devices/sdkconfig.<name>; s=build-<name>/sdkconfig
   grep '^CONFIG_' "$o" | while IFS= read -r l; do
     k=${l%%=*}
     case $l in *=n) ! grep -q "^$k=" "$s" ;; *) grep -qxF "$l" "$s" ;; esac ||
       echo "not applied: $l"
   done
   ```

3. Check the `check_sizes` line ("Smallest app partition is ..."). Flag
   anything under 10% free.
4. Rebuild what you touched: `idf.py build`, plus the ideaspark and SenseCAP
   Indicator if you changed `led_status.c`, or another board with the full UI if you changed
   `components/muse`. UI and other builds share `managed_components/`, so
   delete it and `dependencies.lock` between them.
5. Run the host tests: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'`.
6. On hardware, flash and capture the boot with `tools/muse/monitor.py PORT 30`
   (for a board with the full UI, `$(tools/muse/ports.py <alias>)` gives the port).
   You should see `link.main: Muse Gadget starting` and the `link.led: LED
   status ready: ...` line for your backend, PSRAM found if the board has it,
   and no panic or reboot loop. The status should breathe orange, and a BLE
   scan should show `<prefix>-XXXXXX`.

If you don't have the board, say that the port was only built, not run.
