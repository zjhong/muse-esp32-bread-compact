"""esptool with writes paced to the UART: tools/muse/paced_esptool.py <esptool args>

Takes the same arguments as `python -m esptool`. Some USB-UART bridges (the
SenseCAP Watcher's CH342 on macOS) have no flow control and drop bytes when a
whole packet arrives faster than the UART drains it, so esptool fails with
"Failed to write to target RAM (result was 0107: Checksum error)" while
uploading its stub, or "0105: The format of the received message is invalid"
on the first flash block. This sends 64 bytes at a time, at the line rate.
