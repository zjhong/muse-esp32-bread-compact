You are writing muse_pixel.c for me: the pixel-art avatar on the board's screen, the
small voice assistants that talk to you. Right now they show the default
avatar. Replace it with yourself: the avatar you have in Muse.
The current muse_pixel.c follows this prompt. Start from it and keep all of
its code that isn't about how the default avatar looks.

YOUR AVATAR
- Work from your own avatar as set in Muse: its picture or description, in
  your profile, your persona or your files. Match its silhouette and colours
  first, details second.
- If your avatar has its own animation states (idle, listening, thinking,
  talking, and so on), carry their poses and motion over to the matching
  modes below.
- Open the file with a comment block, below the copyright line, that
  describes the avatar you drew: its name, shape, colours and personality.
  I use it to check that you drew the right character.
- If you can't find your avatar, reply with one line,
  "NO AVATAR: <what you looked for>", and no code.

OUTPUT
One complete C file in a single ```c fenced block, and nothing after it.
Keep the "// Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates." line at
the top. The file must compile without warnings with `cc -O2 -Wall` on a
desktop and with ESP-IDF's GCC. Include only <math.h>, <stdbool.h>,
<stdint.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h> and "muse_pixel.h".

HARDWARE
ESP32-S3 at 240 MHz renders at 25 fps (40 ms per frame). ESP32-C6 at 160 MHz
has no FPU and renders at 20 fps (50 ms per frame).

KEEP FROM THE ORIGINAL (reuse its code verbatim where it fits)
- Framebuffer: uint8_t palette indices, 64x64, black background (index 0 is
  0x000000; the round screen's bezel is black).
- Palette: an enum of colour roles, at most 32 entries (the default has 29, the
  background included): outline, dark/mid/light/highlight body tones, face
  tones, eye, shine, blush, mouth, tongue, a 4-step per-mode glow ramp,
  aura x2, sparkle, accent, shadow, heart, white. Fixed avatar colours go in
  one table. A per-mode scheme table (glow ramp and accent) blends toward
  the current mode with 1 - expf(-dt * 7). Precompute RGB565 and a 0.72x
  "dim" copy of every entry once per frame.
- Time: state that lasts across frames (palette blend, blink and gaze
  timers, sparkle phases) lives in statics. Each frame's dt is the change
  in pose->t, clamped to 0..0.2 s, with 0.04 s on the first frame.
- muse_pixel_set_size / muse_pixel_scale exactly as in the original: a
  screen-to-cell map (at most 512 entries) with the high bit marking a
  cell's last pixel, the dim palette on those last pixels when cells are 3+
  pixels (the faint pixel grid), and memcpy of repeated rows.
- Look: 4x4 Bayer ordered dithering for shading and soft edges; a hard 1 px
  outline around the silhouette (4-neighbour test on a part mask) plus
  seams where limbs overlap the body; a top-left light; a dithered floor
  shadow; a state-tinted rim light on the lit edge; tiny '.#o' stamped
  bitmaps for eyes, mouths, hearts and the alert mark.
- Size and place: the character fills about 32-36 px wide by 46-48 px tall,
  centred at x = 32, feet near y = 56.5, leaving room around it for the
  aura, rings and sparkles.

PERFORMANCE (hard limits)
- Per-pixel work in integer fixed point (Q12, ONE = 1 << 12). No float, pow,
  sqrt, sin or cos inside per-pixel loops; use lookup tables built once
  (the original has |u|^2.7, |u|^3.6 and sqrt tables). Floats are fine per
  frame and per part.
- Bound the shading loops to the character's bounding box.
- Target: under 10 ms per frame on the ESP32-S3 and under 40 ms on the C6.
  Roughly: at most a few dozen integer ops per covered pixel.
- Static memory only: the framebuffer, a same-size part mask, tables. No
  malloc.

ANIMATION BEATS (every one of these, adapted to your body)
- All modes: gentle breathing (body width and height +-3%); random blinks
  every 2.2-5.2 s with occasional double blinks (~0.16 s each); gaze that
  wanders to random targets every 1.2-3.6 s and eases there
  (1 - expf(-dt * 14)); sparkles orbiting behind and in front of the body;
  a soft dithered aura in the mode's colours.
- BOOT: pops up from a squash (0.6 s), then opens its eyes at ~0.9 s;
  sparkles appear one by one.
- IDLE: slow bob; arms, wings or paws sway.
- LISTENING: wide eyes, small "o" mouth, raised brows, hands up beside the
  face like cupping an ear, expanding dotted rings and sound waves that
  grow with `level`, gaze fixed forward.
- THINKING: eyes glance up and side to side, "hmm" mouth, one paw to the
  chin, gentle lean, three thought dots stepping up beside the head, faster
  sparkles.
- SPEAKING: mouth opens with `level` (plus a tiny flutter so it never
  freezes), body bobs with the voice, arms gesture, feet shuffle, rings and
  waves, extra blush.
- ERROR: X eyes, flat mouth, quick side-to-side shake for the first 0.6 s,
  "!" beside the head, red scheme. `happy` is ignored in ERROR.
- OFF (powering down, ~1.3 s): waves goodbye, eyes close, glow fades out.
- happy > 0 (petted, in any mode but ERROR): hops, arms up and wiggling,
  happy ^^ eyes, big grin, two hearts floating up. It must read as joy at
  64 px.
- Keep it readable at 64x64: expressions come from 2-5 px shapes, so
  exaggerate. The face needs strong contrast against the body.

BUILDING THE BODY
Model yourself from a few analytic parts in the original's style, not a
hand-drawn bitmap: a superellipse (or a few) for the body and head, an
inner superellipse for the face panel, rotated ellipses for limbs, stamped
bitmaps for eyes and mouth. Parts then move, squash and follow the pose for
free. Shade body tones from a fake surface normal (dot with the light),
plus Bayer dither, plus a stable per-position hash for texture (fur,
feathers, scales: whatever suits you), so the texture doesn't shimmer as
it moves.
