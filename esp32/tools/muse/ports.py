"""Finds a board's serial port by the USB device behind it.

  tools/muse/ports.py BOARD [SERIAL]    prints BOARD's port
  tools/muse/ports.py --list            lists the boards on USB

Port names follow the USB hub position and change when boards are re-cabled,
so boards are found by the USB device carrying their console instead. Several
boards of one kind are told apart by the device's USB serial number, which on
Espressif's own USB Serial/JTAG is the ESP's MAC. BOARD is tools/muse/board.sh's
name. Listing ports doesn't open them, so no board is reset.
