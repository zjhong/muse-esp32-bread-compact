"""Put your avatar on your board: ask Muse for it, build it and flash it.

    python3 tools/muse/avatar.py                        the whole thing
    python3 tools/muse/avatar.py --edit "bigger ears"   change the avatar you have
    python3 tools/muse/avatar.py --no-flash             stop after the build
    python3 tools/muse/avatar.py --reply FILE           use a reply you got from Muse yourself

1. Finds the board on USB and checks it's connected to your Muse.
2. Sends Muse the prompt (tools/muse/avatar_prompt.md) and the current renderer
   through the board (tools/muse/chat.py), so this machine needs no token.
3. Saves the C file Muse sends back as components/muse/avatar/muse_pixel.c.
   That directory is gitignored; the build uses the file in place of the default avatar.
4. Builds and runs it here, and renders one GIF per animation to
   components/muse/avatar/gifs/. Errors go back to Muse to fix, twice at most.
5. Builds the firmware for the board and flashes it.

Exit status: 0 done, 1 failed, 2 no usable board, 3 the board isn't set up.
