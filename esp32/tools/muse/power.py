"""What a board did on its last run on battery.

    python3 tools/muse/power.py [--port PORT]              the report
    python3 tools/muse/power.py --mah 450                  and the average current, for a 450 mAh cell
    python3 tools/muse/power.py --json                     the board's "@power" JSON
    python3 tools/muse/power.py --reset                    start a new measurement

A measurement starts when USB is unplugged and stops when it comes back, so:
unplug, leave the board be (a few hours: the fuel gauge moves in 1% steps),
plug it back in, run this. The board keeps the last measurement across a
reset, so one that restarts when its port opens, or that crashed on battery,
still has it. components/muse/muse_battery.h has the details. Needs pyserial.
