// Internal glue between the Noise session owner (noise_control.cpp) and the
// tunnel data-plane stream (noise_tunnel.cpp). Not part of the public API.
//
// noise_control.cpp owns the single ClientSession and its event loop. The
// tunnel multiplexes onto that session as a second stream. To avoid pulling
// noise core C++ types into this header, the session owner passes an opaque
// context plus a small set of function pointers the tunnel uses to emit
// outbound ServiceFrames; the tunnel exposes lifecycle + pump hooks the
// session owner calls.
