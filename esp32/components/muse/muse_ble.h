 * BLE "phone setup" service. Home Link owns the NimBLE stack and advertises as
 * "Muse-XXXXXX"; this adds one GATT service to Link's server:
 *
 *   CMD    (write)       "key=value" text: wifi.ssid, wifi.pass, wifi.connect,
 *                        wifi.forget (=ssid forgets that one, bare forgets all
 *                        saved networks), hatch.host, hatch.vm, hatch.token,
 *                        hatch.token+ (append chunk), hatch.test, volume,
 *                        mic_gain, brightness, sleep
 *   STATUS (read/notify) JSON snapshot; notifies a short result after each CMD
 *
 * Both require an encrypted, MITM-protected link: the phone pairs with the
 * 6-digit passkey Muse shows on screen. See tools/ble_setup.html.
