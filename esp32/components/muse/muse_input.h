 * Buttons, as the board reports them. The talk button is push-to-talk. On touch
 * boards the aux button puts the screen to sleep; holding it 1.5 s powers off,
 * and two quick presses toggle BLE phone setup. Without touch it opens the
 * two-button menu instead (muse_menu.h), where talk selects. Either button
 * wakes from sleep; the talk button's press is also posted, marked `wake`, so
 * holding it on through waking records a note. Waking also retries Wi-Fi at
 * once if it's down. Also runs auto-sleep and refreshes battery status into
 * muse_state.
