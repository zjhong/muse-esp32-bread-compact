 * LVGL on a QSPI panel, drawn in a few tall bands in PSRAM.
 *
 * LVGL walks every widget once per band it draws, so a full screen in 4 tall
 * bands rather than 40-odd short ones is what lets a swipe keep up with the
 * finger. The SPI DMA can't read PSRAM fast enough while both cores draw, so a
 * task copies each band out a few rows at a time, into one of two internal
 * buffers while the other is on the wire. LVGL draws the next band meanwhile,
 * in the panel's byte order so nothing has to swap each one.

 * One task sends to the panel, on MUSE_UI_CORE, and the panel's SPI interrupt
 * has to be there too. ESP-IDF's SPI bus lock can lose a task waiting for the
 * bus if the interrupt that finishes a transfer is on the other core: the
 * interrupt decides nobody is waiting, the task starts to, and it waits
 * forever with the screen half drawn. An interrupt goes to the core of the
 * task that set it up, so set up the panel's SPI bus from a task pinned to
 * MUSE_UI_CORE.
