# Philips Hue Bridges: Local Light and Scene Control

Use this skill when fresh discovery identifies a Hue bridge exposing CLIP v2 and the user requests lights, brightness or an existing scene.

## Identify the Device

- Match a Hue bridge, not an individual Zigbee bulb. `_hue._tcp` and bridge metadata can identify the current endpoint.
- Read bridge model/API information, such as `/api/0/config`, after host authorization. Confirm CLIP v2 support on the square BSB002 bridge.
- Round BSB001 uses a different legacy API and is not covered by this recipe.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- Use an existing local application key or obtain one with the user's physical bridge-button approval. An account/cloud discovery service is not required.
- For pairing, POST a documented `devicetype` to `/api` while the link-button window is open and securely store the returned username/application key. Do not log it.
- Validate the bridge's TLS identity using a configured/pinned bridge trust path; do not disable certificate validation globally.

## Workflow

1. Send the stored key in the `hue-application-key` header through a credential-aware client, never as a credential-bearing shell command.
2. GET `/clip/v2/resource/light`, `/room`, `/zone` and `/scene` as needed. Resolve resource IDs from current responses and disambiguate names before writes.
3. Read the target light's on/dimming/color capability fields and connectivity. Only send fields the device actually supports.
4. PUT `/clip/v2/resource/light/<id>` with a minimal body such as `{"on":{"on":true}}` or `{"dimming":{"brightness":40}}`. Brightness is percent; honor the reported minimum. Color temperature, when requested and supported, uses the reported `mirek_schema` range.
5. For an existing room/zone, resolve its `grouped_light` service before a group write. For an existing scene, PUT `/clip/v2/resource/scene/<id>` with `{"recall":{"action":"active"}}`. Confirm the affected group is intended.
6. Inspect both response `data` and `errors`, then poll the affected lights after transitions. Group broadcasts can miss an individual bulb.

## Verify the Result

- Confirm resulting per-light state, not only a group response or scene acknowledgement.
- For a group where every lamp must change, identify any straggler and re-read before an individually scoped correction.
- A scene may contain multiple intended states; compare to its actions rather than assuming every member should be on.

## Limits

- No UDP Entertainment streaming, cloud discovery, automatic firmware updates, group creation or automation editing in this skill.
- Check capabilities separately for Bridge Pro and each bulb. Unsupported effects remain unsupported.
