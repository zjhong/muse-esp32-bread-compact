# Google TV Streamer

Use this skill when the confirmed Google TV Streamer advertises a usable Cast receiver and/or Android TV Remote v2 service.

## Identify the Device

- Match Google TV Streamer model identity and current firmware/service metadata rather than assuming every Google TV device is this model.
- Keep Cast and Remote v2 endpoints distinct. Availability of one does not prove the other has paired or can control the device.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- An already-provisioned device with the relevant interface available.
- For Remote v2, a compatible `androidtvremote2` client, the normal on-screen pairing code and securely retained client certificate/private key.
- For media playback, a user-approved source the receiver can already reach.

## Workflow

1. For Cast media, volume and status, use the [Google Cast skill](../gadget-google-cast/SKILL.md), including receiver capabilities and result checks.
2. For Remote v2, use the confirmed service and the client's documented pairing/control connection setup over HomeLink TCP. Do not treat an open control port as a paired session.
3. If necessary, start normal user-approved pairing, complete the displayed code challenge and retain the client certificate/private key. Pairing and control are separate connections.
4. After authenticated connection, send the requested documented remote key or app link using the compatible client. Use supported power/volume behavior only when exposed by this device.
5. Observe available state and ask for visual confirmation where navigation has no reliable programmatic read-back.

## Verify the Result

- Keep discovery, pairing success and remote-control success as separate outcomes.
- For Cast, follow the shared skill and do not count an app launch or buffering state as playback.

## Limits

- No screenshots, package queries/installation, battery/screen inspection, developer/debugging setup or fallback control.
- No universal foreground-app query, app entitlement or off-state wake promise.
