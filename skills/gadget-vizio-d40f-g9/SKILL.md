# VIZIO D40f-G9

Use this skill when the confirmed VIZIO D40f-G9 exposes a compatible SmartCast local management service.

## Identify the Device

- Confirm exact model and firmware from existing device information and the current service endpoint.
- VIZIO SmartCast management and Google Cast are different interfaces. A SmartCast product name alone does not prove a currently available Cast receiver.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- An already-configured TV and a compatible pyvizio client over HomeLink HTTPS.
- Normal on-screen PIN pairing when required, secure storage of the returned authentication token, and appropriate device-specific TLS trust.
- Permission for the requested TV operation; media playback also requires a suitable receiver-reachable source.

## Workflow

1. Use the documented SmartCast pairing challenge/PIN flow with the user, or reuse valid stored credentials. Do not bypass the pairing prompt.
2. Read available power, input, app and remote-control state using the model-compatible client. Resolve IDs from device responses.
3. Perform the requested supported input/app/remote action and retain API result/error information. Do not assume a generic endpoint works on every firmware.
4. Read state after the action. If the TV is in a standby mode that disables its network API, report that limitation.
5. For an independently advertised Cast receiver, follow the [Google Cast skill](../gadget-google-cast/SKILL.md) for media/status/volume; keep its sessions and verification distinct from SmartCast management.

## Verify the Result

- Confirm token-authorized access and the resulting TV state separately.
- A remote-key acknowledgment may need visual confirmation; it does not prove successful navigation.
- A Cast load is successful only under the shared skill's playback checks.

## Limits

- No UDP wake, universal standby access, cloud control, firmware changes or general app installation.
- No duplicate Cast procedure or assumed media hosting.
