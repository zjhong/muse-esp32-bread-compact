# TP-Link Kasa EP25: Authenticated Switching and Energy Readings

Use this skill when fresh discovery identifies a compatible Kasa EP25 and the user requests switching, energy readings or supported auto-off.

## Identify the Device

- Confirm EP25 model, hardware/firmware, protocol family, encryption/login version and local service endpoint from available discovery metadata and authenticated device information.
- This path uses SMART local authentication, not EP10 legacy XOR. A port alone does not identify KLAP/AES or login version.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- Provide the device's approved TP-Link local-authentication credentials or supported stored credential hash through secure storage. These authenticate locally; no cloud-control login is part of the runtime flow.
- Know what load is attached. If credentials or the protocol configuration are missing, request setup instead of guessing or resetting.

## Workflow

1. Configure python-kasa for the known SMART device/transport and exact discovered endpoint; use HomeLink network routing instead of the library's broadcast discovery.
2. Authenticate and update device state. Read supported features before invoking a capability; keep raw feature dumps private because they can include setup codes.
3. Use `turn_on`/`turn_off` for requested relay changes. LED and auto-off features are separate operations; change them only when explicitly requested and exposed by this device.
4. Read the energy module/features for actual power and totals, preserving their reported units. Availability differs across firmware.
5. For auto-off, use the actual `auto_off_enabled` and `auto_off_minutes` features if present; read back both. Do not treat unsupported schedule APIs as equivalent.
6. Refresh after each action and inspect authentication/device errors separately from connection failures.

## Verify the Result

- Confirm resulting relay/LED state and requested auto-off settings.
- Report measured consumption with units; a working relay is not proof that the attached appliance is drawing power.

## Limits

- The SMART path does not support the legacy schedule module. Do not add schedules or use cloud/Matter/Home automation fallbacks.
- No reset, re-keying, Wi-Fi changes or firmware updates. Other Kasa/Tapo products require their own capability checks.
