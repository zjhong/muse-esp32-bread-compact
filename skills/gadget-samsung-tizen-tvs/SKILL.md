# Samsung Tizen TVs

Use this skill when a confirmed Samsung Tizen TV exposes a compatible local remote WebSocket service.

## Identify the Device

- Confirm model, firmware and the actual remote endpoint. A Frame model's Art API is separate from the general remote interface.
- Use the returned device information and installed client's compatibility notes; do not infer Art support from the Samsung brand alone.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- A compatible local WebSocket client routed through HomeLink, with device-specific TLS trust preserved.
- User approval of the normal TV pairing prompt when required, and secure storage/reuse of its returned token.
- Permission for the requested screen/audio/app action. Frame art changes require permission for the particular content and operation.

## Workflow

1. Establish the documented local remote connection with a recognizable client name and valid saved token, or complete normal user-approved pairing.
2. Read available device, power, app or Art status using interfaces documented for this model. Do not substitute a cloud API when a local read is unavailable.
3. For remote control, send only the requested supported key or application operation; resolve real app identifiers rather than guessing them.
4. On an Art-capable Frame with a supported Art API version, use its documented status/mode, available-art selection or requested upload operation. Transfer only user-approved media through the documented local client protocol, and authorize any additional destination it requires.
5. Check the relevant response and available state after each action. Do not use a key sequence as an unverified substitute for an unavailable direct operation.

## Verify the Result

- A WebSocket acknowledgment or accepted key does not prove the desired on-screen outcome; use state read-back or user confirmation.
- Check Art API version/errors separately from remote pairing. Remote success does not establish Art support.
- Inspect state before retrying power or other toggle-like commands.

## Limits

- No cloud alternatives, UDP wake or device-to-agent media fetch without an existing reachable source.
- No universal Frame Art coverage, app installation, unrequested content replacement/deletion or firmware changes.
- A sleeping TV may not expose its API; do not promise wake from network presence alone.
