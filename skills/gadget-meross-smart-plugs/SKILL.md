# Meross Smart Plugs

Use this skill when the exact Meross plug and firmware support the signed local HTTP interface and its existing device key is available.

## Identify the Device

- Confirm the device UUID, model and firmware; a Meross vendor label alone is insufficient.
- Use the discovered local HTTP service and documented `/config` endpoint. HomeKit-branded variants must still be checked for this interface.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- The device UUID and existing local key, supplied through approved secret storage.
- A direct protocol client or an agent-authored implementation of the documented request envelope. Use the community implementation as a protocol reference; installing its host platform is not required.
- Permission to switch the actual load attached to the plug.

## Workflow

1. Send a signed read for `Appliance.System.All` and, where supported, `Appliance.System.Ability`. Use the protocol's message ID, timestamp, namespace, method, device context and signature exactly as documented.
2. Inspect reported abilities and current channel states. A device may expose `Appliance.Control.ToggleX`, an older toggle namespace or another model-specific interface; choose what it actually supports.
3. For a requested relay change, send the documented `SET` for that namespace and channel with the desired on/off value. Do not guess a channel or reuse an unrelated model's payload.
4. Validate the matching response, method/error information and message identity, then read state again using the supported namespace.

## Verify the Result

- A transport success or signed acknowledgment does not prove relay state. Compare a fresh state response with the requested channel/value.
- Do not infer power consumption from relay state, or promise metering unless the device advertises and documents that feature.

## Limits

- Cloud account/key acquisition is not part of this runtime skill. Stop for missing credentials; do not reset or re-pair the plug.
- No universal Meross model support, arbitrary namespace writes, firmware updates or separate HomeKit onboarding procedure.
