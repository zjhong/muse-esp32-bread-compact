# Google Home Max

Use this skill when current discovery identifies the Google Home Max.

## Identify the Device

- Match Google Home Max model metadata and its current receiver identity. Existing groups are separate targets from the individual speaker.
- Match the current receiver to the user's intended device; use its current service endpoint, not a remembered address.
- This is an audio-only receiver. Cast support does not establish local control over its physical auxiliary input or all input-switching behavior.

## Prerequisites

Follow the shared HomeLink networking and safety rules in `home_link.md`.

- The device is already provisioned and available as a receiver in its supported operating state.
- For new playback, an existing user-authorized media source must be reachable by the receiver. Device access alone does not supply media hosting.

## Workflow

1. Use the [Google Cast skill](../gadget-google-cast/SKILL.md) for discovery interpretation, receiver/media status, playback controls, volume, media loading and verification. That skill is the single protocol procedure.
2. Apply this profile's model and operating-state restrictions before selecting an operation. Missing media status while idle is not proof that the device is unreachable.
3. For an existing group, follow the shared skill's separate group-target rules and confirm that the user intended all group members.

## Verify the Result

- Follow the shared skill's operation-specific checks and report whether the result was actually observed on this device.

## Limits

- Do not create groups, assume arbitrary input control, or use private setup-token routes.
- Do not infer device administration or general remote-control capabilities from Cast support.
